    "HousePricesRecords.csv (in outputs/datasets/collection/) will be used to create data visualizations that show trends between house features and prices. \n",
    "InheritedHouses.csv (in outputs/datasets/collection/) includes the specific properties the client owns. These will be passed to the prediction model to estimate their expected sale prices."
